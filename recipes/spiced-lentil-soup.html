        <h2 class="sub-heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, lightly drained</li>
            <li>1 cup brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, more to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice (½ to 1 medium lemon), to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.</li>
            <li>Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.</li>
            <li>Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Securely fasten the lid, protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the lid, and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back into the pot. (Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.)</li>
            <li>Add the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens have softened to your liking. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing. For spicier soup, add another pinch or two of red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Serve while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months (just defrost before serving).</li>
        </ol>
