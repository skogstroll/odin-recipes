        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>2 bacon hocks</li>
            <li>12 cups of water</li>
            <li>1 500g pack of dried green split peas</li>

        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Dice the brown onion</li>
            <li>Put the water, ham hocks, and onion into a pot and bring to a boil</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and leave it for 1.5 to 2 hours</li>
            <li>Once the ham is tender and lifts from the bone, remove the ham hocks from the water and strip them of the meat. Chop this meat into the size you'd like and return them to the soup. Cook for another 30mins or until all the peas are completely softened.</li>
            <li>Pop in a few shakes of salt and a generous amount of pepper. Bob is your uncle. Serve.</li>
